This project is part of a virtual consulting firm's ongoing digital transformation, where gender equality has become a strategic priority. In response to French legal requirements, this project aims to automate the process of creating a diagnostic report on gender equality in the workplace.

The report is generated using data from the company's Human Resources Information System (HRIS) and includes charts and statistical tests (performed in KNIME using R language), based on 5 key indicators (Recruitment, Promotion, Qualification, Workplace Health and Safety, Remuneration). The workflow is built using the KNIME software, and data is processed to comply with GDPR regulations. The objective is to promote transparency, improve gender equality policy, enhance the employer brand, and thus attract top talent.
