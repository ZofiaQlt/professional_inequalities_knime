This project is part of a growing consulting firm's digital transformation efforts, where gender equality has become a strategic priority. In response to French legal requirements, this project aims to automate the process of creating a diagnostic report on gender equality in the workplace.

The report is generated from the company's Human Resources Information System (HRIS) data and includes charts based on 5 relevant indicators (Recruitment, Promotion, Qualification, Workplace Health and Safety, Remuneration). The workflow is built using the KNIME software, and data is processed to comply with GDPR regulations. The objective is to improve gender equality policy, promote transparency, enhance the employer brand, and attract top talent.
